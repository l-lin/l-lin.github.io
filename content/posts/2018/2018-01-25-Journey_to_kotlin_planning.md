Kotlin is really a promising programming language nowadays and is gaining lots of popularity.
It will be a shame to pass by without trying to use this language.

<!--more-->

I'd never written about my experience when learning new language. This blog post is mostly used to encourage myself to try to learn as much as I can and hopefully, to apply my learning in real situation.

I'm a developer, but I mostly code in Java. So the purpose of this journey is to see what Kotlin can offer from Java from my own perspective and how I can apply it in my daily life.

# The plan

1. I'm planning to first learn the basics from the [Kotlin EduTools plugin][] and [Kotlin official documentation][]
1. Then, I will try to create a simple TODO application using only Kotlin
1. I will have to learn how to migrate a Java application into a Kotlin
1. I will also learn to maintain and evolve a project containing both Java and Kotlin
1. Finally, if I really like Kotlin (in favor of Java), I will try to advocate the programming language to my teammates
