# set default variable
# can be override by setting in argument: make app_name=popo
app_name=foobar
# set a variable from command
project_name=$(shell basename "$(PWD)")
# only set variable if env variable is not already defined
JAVA_HOME?=/opt/java
# stops commandline arguments from changing this variable
override username=admin

# variables can be used using $() or ${}
echo-variables:
	@echo ${app_name}
	@echo $(project_name)

# avoid phony rules breaking when a real file has the same name as the command

# multi lines are possible, but the shell receives the whole command concatenated into a single
# line, so we also need to terminate with a semi-colon
#
# escape with a $ for using bash scripts and variables
