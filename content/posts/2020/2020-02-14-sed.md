SED is a powerful stream editor for filtering and transforming text. You can perform impressive
and efficient operations with such tool.

In this post, we will discover the wonders of SED.

## Text conversion and substitution

```bash
# match "pattern" against the pattern space and replace the 1st occurrence of each line
# with "replacement" if successful matched
sed 's/pattern/replacement/'
# you can refer the pattern matching sub-expressions with special escapes \1 through \9
# /!\ parenthesis and plus sign must be escaped, otherwise sed will consider it as a simple character
sed 's/^foo\(\w\+\)/\1/'

# replace only the 4th instance of each line by adding a number
sed 's/pattern/replacement/4'

# replace ALL instances of each file by adding "g"
sed 's/pattern/replacement/g'

# find lines that contain "foobar" and replace "pattern" with "replacement"
sed '/foobar/s/pattern/replacement/g'

# search "pattern" and substitute with "replacement" except lines containing "foobar"
sed '/foobar/!s/pattern/replacement/g'

# if you want to edit files in place, add the flag "-i"
sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/g' filename.txt

# replace commas with newlines (use \r, not \n)
sed 's/,/\r/g'
```

## Selective deletion

```bash
# remove last character
sed '$s/.$//'

# delete last line
sed '$d'

# delete lines matching pattern
sed '/pattern/d'

# delete 2nd line
sed '2d'

# delete the first 10 lines
sed '1,10d'

# delete ALL blank lines
sed '/^$/d'
```

## Print

```bash
# -n flag hides lines not affected by the expression, often useful in print statements

# print lines that contain "pattern"
sed -n '/pattern/p'

# print 2nd line
sed -n '2p'
```

## Tricks

```bash
# you can perform multiple sed operations
# instead of
sed 's/foo/bar/g' | sed 's/bar/popo/g'

# you can do this
sed -e 's/foo/bar/g' -e 's/bar/popo/g'

# or even this
sed 's/foo/bar/g;s/bar/popo/g'

# you can substitute "/" with another character
sed 's~foo~bar~'

# append "foobar" after lines matching "pattern"
sed '/pattern/a foobar'
# prepend "foobar" before lines matching "pattern"
sed '/pattern/i foobar'

# append "foobar" after 2nd line
sed '2a foobar'
# prepend "foobar" before 2nd line
sed '2i foobar'

# insert 2 blank spaces at beginning of each line
sed 's/^/  /'
```
