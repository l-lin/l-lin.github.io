<h1>Welcome to LLIN FooBar blog</h1>

<p>
    Hello! This blog was created mainly to store my tips and tricks, feedbacks, some patterns, some installation guide,...
    Well some technical stuffs. That's all.
    <br />
    I decided to share some of my discoveries/thought (and bullshits?), so I hope you will find this blog interesting, if not, sorry about that.
</p>
<p>
    You have certainly notice that English is not my native language.
    Do not hesitate to remind me how awful my English is! :)
    <br />
    I will try to improve as much as I can.
